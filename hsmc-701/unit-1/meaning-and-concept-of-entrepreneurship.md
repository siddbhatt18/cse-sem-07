## ✅ 1. What is Entrepreneurship?

**Entrepreneurship** is the process of designing, launching, and running a **new business**, which typically begins as a **small business**, such as a startup company, offering a product, process, or service for sale or hire.

But beyond just “starting a business”, entrepreneurship involves:

- **Identifying opportunities** in the market.
- **Mobilizing resources** (capital, people, technology).
- **Taking calculated risks** to create value.
- **Innovating** to solve problems or meet unmet needs.
- **Creating economic and social value** through sustainable ventures.

> 💡 **Peter F. Drucker**:  
> *“Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice.”*  
> He emphasized that entrepreneurship is about *doing*, not just knowing — it’s action-oriented.

## ✅ 2. Core Elements of Entrepreneurship

|--------|-------------|
| **Innovation** | Introducing something new — product, service, method, market, or organization. Not all entrepreneurs invent, but all must innovate in some way. |
| **Risk-taking** | Willingness to face uncertainty and potential failure. Entrepreneurs don’t avoid risk — they *manage* it. |
| **Vision & Initiative** | Ability to see opportunity where others see chaos, and take initiative without waiting for instructions. |
| **Value Creation** | Creating value for customers, employees, investors, and society — not just profit. |
| **Resourcefulness** | Doing more with less. Entrepreneurs often bootstrap, pivot, and adapt using limited resources. |
