## Introduction

Entrepreneurship is the backbone of economic development and innovation in modern society. It represents the spirit of creating something new, taking calculated risks, and transforming ideas into viable business ventures. This chapter explores the fundamental meaning and concepts that define entrepreneurship.

## Definition of Entrepreneurship

### Classical Definition
Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching, and running a new business, which typically begins as a small business offering a product, process, or service for sale or hire.

### Academic Perspectives

1. **Joseph Schumpeter (1934)**: "Entrepreneurship is the process of creative destruction, where new innovations replace outdated technologies and business models."

2. **Peter Drucker (1985)**: "Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice. It is a knowledge base... but as in all practices, medicine, for instance, or engineering, knowledge in entrepreneurship is a means to an end."
