- Static threshold values may not be effective as data changes
- Need for automated and dynamic hyperparameter optimization approaches

#### Algorithm Selection
Choosing the appropriate learning algorithm for specific applications is challenging, requiring in-depth analysis for better understanding and decision making.

### 5. **Ethical and Social Concerns**

#### Bias in AI Models
- Models inherit biases from training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory decisions
- Can reinforce societal prejudices in applications like hiring, lending, and law enforcement
- Requires careful monitoring and correction mechanisms

#### Privacy Issues
